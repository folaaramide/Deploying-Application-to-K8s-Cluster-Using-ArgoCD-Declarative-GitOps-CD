# ðŸš€ GitOps CI/CD with ArgoCD, Kubernetes & GitHub

As a **Cloud and DevOps enthusiast**, I built a hands-on project implementing a **declarative GitOps-based CI/CD pipeline** using **ArgoCD**, **Kubernetes**, and **GitHub**.

This project automates deployment workflows and maintains state consistency across Kubernetes environments using GitOps principles.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Objective

Deploy a web application to a Kubernetes cluster with **ArgoCD** managing the application state declaratively and automatically from a **GitHub** repository. The process is:

- Automated  
- Secure  
- Observable  

## ðŸ§­ Project Architecture

GitHub Repo (App Manifests) - > ArgoCD (in K8s) - > Kubernetes Cluster (App Deployed via Sync)
